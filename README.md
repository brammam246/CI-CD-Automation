Continuous Integration and Deployment for a Web Application

Pre-required
1.Git
2.Maven
3.Jenkins
4.Selenium
5.Nexus 
6.Prometheus
7.GitHub
8.AWS
9.Docker
10.Ansible
11.MongoDB
12.ELK


Steps:

1.Choose a Web Application: Select a basic web application to work with.

2.Version Control: Set up a Git repository to host your web application code. Use platforms GitHub or GitLab.

3.Build Automation: Choose a build tool like Maven and create a build script. This script should compile/build your application and create the necessary artifacts.

4.Automated Testing: Integrate automated testing into your project. Write unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

5.Continuous Integration: Set up a Jenkins server . Configure it to monitor your Git repository for changes and trigger automated builds and tests whenever new code is pushed.

6.Artifact Storage: After successful builds, store the artifacts in an artifact repository on Nexus.

7.Continuous Deployment: Configure your Jenkins server to automatically deploy the application to a staging environment when the tests pass successfully.

8.Monitoring and Logging: Implement basic monitoring and logging for your deployed application. This involve using tools like Prometheus for monitoring and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for logging.
